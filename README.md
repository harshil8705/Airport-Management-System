## Airport Management System

---

**This is an enterprise-level, scalable, secure, and AI-powered backend system for Airport Management.**

<br>

**This project is currently under development, and I’m consistently working on it.**

<br>

**As of now, I’m designing the Low-Level Design (LLD) for the system using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and a temporary in-memory relational database: H2 Console.**

<br>

### Planned Updates

- Use of **DTOs** for handling request and response models across different functionalities.
- Implementing **basic CRUD operations** on each database entity.
- **Securing** the system using **Spring Security**, enabling **role-based access** for various features.
- Building **Passenger Authentication and Authorization** flows.
- Integrating an **AI chatbot** that interacts with the database, answers user queries, and performs tasks on behalf of users.

<br>

After completing the core modules, I plan to implement an **AI-powered Recommendation System** that suggests airports to passengers based on their system interactions.

This AI system will be developed using **Python's Scikit-learn** library and exposed as a microservice using the **Flask** web framework.

<br>

Yeah, building this enterprise-grade backend system will take time, but I’m working on it **consistently** — day in and day out.

**Thanks for being part of my journey in building this enterprise-level backend for Airport Management.**

### Thank You!
