## Airport Management System
---
-> This is the Enterprise Level huge, scalable, secure, and AI powered backend System of Airport Management System.
-> This Project is currently in the Development and I am working on this project consistently.
-> As of Now I am desigining the Low Level Design for the Airport Management System in Java, using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and temperory relational database: H2 Console.

-> Updates that I've planned to bring into this System:
- Use of DTO's for Response and Request of different functionallity of this System.
- Basic CRUD Operations on each entity of the database.
- Secure this System with Spring Security, enabling the Role based access to the different functionallity of this System.
- Passenger Authentication and Authorization.
- Integrating the AI chatbot that interacts with the Database and provides the accurate answer according to the user prompt and does the work on behalf of User.

-> After completing all this stuff, if the time gives permission I will be adding the AI Powered Reccomendation System that recommends different Airport to the passenger based on the passengers interaction with this System.
-> This AI Powered Recommendation System will be made by using Python's famous AI Library - Scikit Learn and the Flask web Framework for the airport reccomendation microservice.
-> SO yaa this will take time in building this huge Enterprise Level backend system of Airport Management System but yaa I am consistently working on this project and building this every single day.
